## **About our team.**

Our team consists of three members, each assigned a different role:

1. Vichaiwat Koonsap – I am responsible for gathering data for our team members and taking detailed notes, which are then compiled into this documentation.
2. Norapat Kaset – Norapat is responsible for designing and building our robot.
3. Vorawet Narkglom – Vorawet is the programmer who coded the robot.   

## **Engineering Consideration.**

During our robot’s design process, we faced several challenges, most notably converting real-world measurements into our 3D modeling software. After printing, we frequently encountered errors with small features. For instance, a 0.5 mm screw hole could not be printed accurately , resulting in undersized holes. This highlighted the importance of considering printer limitations during design. Careful attention to these details helps prevent unnecessary redesigns and reprints.

Moreover, we also discovered that using a differential is essential. Initially, we placed gears of the same size next to each other, but this method proved ineffective. Incorporating a differential allowed the wheels to rotate at different speeds, which is crucial for smooth turns and overall robot performance.
